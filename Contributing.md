# Contributing Guidelines

## Forking
If you are assigned to an issue or if you want to test the project in your local system, you should fork the project so that you can make changes in your personal space without affecting the orignal repository ðŸ˜Š .

## Creating own branch
If you are working on an issue, you should make a new branch in your forked repository to make that repository manageable. All the changes for a particular issue or for your own testing purpose should be made in that repository.

## Assigning on an issue
Just write a comment on the issue that you would like to work on that and if that issue is free, you will be assigned to the issue as soon as possible.

## Guidance 
While solving the issue, if you want any guidance you can always reach out to the project maintainer. i.e. the one who assigned you in most cases.

## First Contribution
If you are contributing for the first time in this repository, you should begin with solving good-first-issue labelled issues. Those are meant for beginners so that they can have better understanding of the project.

## Successful Contribution 
If you successfully made your first contribution, then you must add your name in the list of contributors.

## Nervous ??
Don't feel nervous if this is your first contribution. Every expert was once a beginner. Feel free to reach out to me for any problem on my social media handles which are given in the readme file ðŸ˜Š .
